What do I want to learn or understand better?

  I'd like to become better at working on complex problems in teams.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

  By helping to instil a culture of openness and togetherness where we dare ask questions and learn together.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

  We'll see. Hopefully I'll be able to build bridges between our stakeholders and team members, ensuring a reasonable and relevant backlog.   

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

  My contribution will depend on what our project encompasses. I'll be happy to help with whatever our team wants and needs.
