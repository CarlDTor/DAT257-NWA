What do I want to learn or understand better?

  I know the basics of git but I would like to integrate it more closely into my development environment. 
  I hope to learn this next week, maybe alongside my teammates.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

  I know a thing or two about operations management. 
  It’d be swell if we as a group could use some techniques from there to facilitate our work going forward. 
  We’ll talk more about our work process next monday.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

  This week, I sat down with the main stakeholder to establish our collective project scope. 
  Some of his desired features will have to be jotted down in the backlog. 
  I know that many of our members are ready to start working on the backlog first thing next week. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

  I helped develop the initial vision for the project and gave it a placeholder logo & name. 
  I also wrote the project scope and used that scope to help Fredrik create our BMC. 
  As a team we should continue to develop our product backlog as well as start working on the first sprint backlog. 
  I’ll try to help that process in our first sprint meeting next monday.
