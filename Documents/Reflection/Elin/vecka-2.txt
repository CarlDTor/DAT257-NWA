What do I want to learn or understand better?
Currently, I want to learn more about Scrum and apply my theoretical knowledge in practice. I am looking forward to beginning to work on the project and practicing my skills in the Scrum-process. Next week we will begin sprint 1 and then I will have the chance to practice this and get a better understanding of the Scrum-process.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Right now, I can help someone else or the entire team to learn something new by encouraging us to challenge ourselves with different tasks and bringing up new ideas and questions to the table . When we begin to work on the project I can continue to share my knowledge and ask questions.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have participated in this week's lectures and exercises to get as much new knowledge as possible to make the process next week when we begin working with Scum in the project as smooth and simple as possible.  To get there I will continue to participate as much as possible and study on my own.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I participated in our group meeting where we came up with an interesting project to work with the following weeks. At the meeting I shared some project ideas I had collected during the week, and also discussed other ideas so that we could decide on a project. I have also created a very basic visual representation of how we visualize our project to look like. Next week I want to take on tasks and continue to contribute to the group's deliverables and results. This I will do by continuing to participate and share my thoughts to make the process run forward, and also take on tasks I think I can deliver.
