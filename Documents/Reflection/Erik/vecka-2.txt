- What do I want to learn or understand better?
The different parts in the SCRUM process. I will get a better understanding next week when we actually apply the lessons learned from the lectures.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have used my previous knowledge to make a strong recommendation on which technologies to use. Next week I can assist in setting up team member's development environments as well as explaining some basic parts of the frameworks.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have started to think about how to apply the "Slicing the cake" exercise on our project.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Participating in meetings and the decision making of what our project will be about. Researching computer vision APIs.
