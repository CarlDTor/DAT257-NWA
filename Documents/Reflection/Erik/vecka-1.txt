- What do I want to learn or understand better?
The different parts in the SCRUM process. How, why, when and how long.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can explain and demonstrate a small example of relevant frameworks that I have previously worked with.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
As I was not able to attend the exercise there was not an opportunity for me to contribute.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Apart from attending the social contract meeting I have given a suggestion for a "third-party person" for our project. I have started to prepare an example to demonstrate popular frameworks that we could use.
