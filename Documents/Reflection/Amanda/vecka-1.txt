- What do I want to learn or understand better?
At the current moment, we have only had two lectures, mainly introducing the concept of SCRUM. Therefore, I do not have as good of a grasp of the concept and what it entails as I would like to. To get to the point where I better understand SCRUM, I am going to look at lecture slides again and do some of my own research on the topic as well. 

Furthermore, I want to get a better understanding regarding the definition of done since I at the moment do not understand it as well as I would like to. 

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
If I know the topic that my team members do not, I can to the best of my abilities try to explain and educate them. However, if I do not have any prior knowledge about the topic, I can try and do my own research and then discuss with my team members until we hopefully all understand. 

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I contribute to the sprint planning, sprint review and the sprint retrospective by engaging in the discussions we have as a team before and after the sprints. Furthermore, I take part in the development part for the sprints for example in the SCRUM exercise we did in MindTest. 

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I engage in the team meetings and make sure everyone knows and understands what has to be done until our next meeting. The only exercise we have had as a group thus far is the SCRUM exercise in MindTest as well as the social contract. During that exercise I helped the team in accomplishing the different sprints we were given, both by completing my individual task that I took upon myself to do, but also asked for help when needed. In the social contract, I participated in the planning of the project as well as how we should work as a group from this point on.
