what do I want to learn or understand better?
I would like to learn how to apply the SCRUM process in a software project starting from scratch.
I would also like to understand how the SCRUM process affects working as a team and what different
methods are used to achieve a better software product.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help others or my team by sharing my thoughts and having discussions with the team on different topics.
I could also explore and research that subject on my own and share my knowledge later.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
During the first week we have not had many chances to use SCRUM except for the minetest excercise.
During the excerise I contributed to some sprint planning, took the responsibility of different parts 
of the user stories and reflected together with the team on each sprint.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week the team deliverable was a social contract. I contributed to this by participating in the meeting
and discussed with the team what we wanted to include in the contract.
