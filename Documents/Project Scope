Our stakeholder needs a web app that: 
  * takes pdf:s of digital ICA-receipts as input and 
  * converts them into text fields storing articles and their respective cost. 
  * Making these conversions storable for later use. 

Our stakeholder would like these additional features (listed in descending order of importance):

  * Ability to manually edit fields in cases where the conversion is imperfect

  * Automatic fetching of receipts from Kivra

  * Option to store receipt conversions as XML files

  * Option to aggregate conversions belonging to a specified time frame

  * Ability to categorize articles (apple â†’ fruit)

  * Generated estimations of expected product lifespan based on time between previous purchases

  * Support for other types of receipts
  
  * Support for mobile
  
  * A customizable cat avatar that reacts positively to articles belonging to the vegetable category
